# Google Appstore-EDA

In this kernal i'm going to do EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) on "Google play store Dataset" taken from kaggle, and see how rating of a particular app varies with 
differnent attributes. This project is totally based on EDA. That how we can manipulate data and use it for models.

I have taken all the features one by one and completed the Data analysis, i have deleted some columns which are not that helpful for any model.
Basically in this notebook, i hvae tried to show  how rating of a particular app gets affected by other attributes like size,price,category of a app ,etc.
